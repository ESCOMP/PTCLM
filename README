PTCLMmkdata is a python tool built on top of CLM tools and CESM scripts
for building datasets to run CLM "I" cases for data from Ameriflux Tower-sites,
or other user-supplied single-point datasets.

General Directory structure:

  models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/PTCLMmkdata ----- Main script
  models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/PTCLM_sitedata  - Site data files of 
        static information latitude, longitude, soil info., and PFT information 
        for each site Also different "groups" of site-data lists, and the script to
        convert the transient years pftdyn files into pftdyn text files that
        mksurfdata can use.
  models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/mydatafiles ----- Default location of
        data files that will be created by PTCLMmkdata. Sites will be built
        in their own subdirectories under here. Optionally you can give your
        own location you'd like to use for your data.
  models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/buildtools ------ Script to build the CLM
        tools needed to run PTCLMmkdata (mksurfdata_map both clm4_0 and clm4_5
        versions and gen_domain). Works on yellowstone.

Quickstart:

# ASSUMPTIONS:
# For this example I'm running a ICLM451PT case on yellowstone using  
# CSMDATA in the standard location
# Finally we use the 6-digit AmeriFlux site code for the University of Mich. Biological
# Station US-UMB (data for this station is checked into the inputdata repository).
# I also assume you are using UNIX C-shell, and GNU make is called gmake
setenv CSMDATA   /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata
setenv SITE      US-UMB


cd models/lnd/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM
setenv MYDATAFILES `pwd`/mydatafiles

# Next build all of the clm tools you will need
# The following script assumes yellowstone_intel, for other machines
# you'll need to build each tool by hand
./buildtools
# next run PTCLMmkdata (NOTE -- MAKE SURE python AND NCL IS IN YOUR PATH)
# NOTE: Every day you run PTCLMmkdata it will remake the map called
#       renamemapfiles to rename files with todays creation date.
#       This makes running PTCLMmkdata a reasonable amount of time.
#       However, you can use the script in mydatafiles
#
./PTCLMmkdata -s $SITE -d $CSMDATA

# Next copy the towersite meterology datafiles into your $MYDATAFILES space
# (For the US-UMB station you can skip this step as the .build step will bring the data over) 
cd $MYDATAFILES/1x1pt_$SITE
mkdir $MYDATAFILES/1x1pt_$SITE/CLM1PT_data
# Copy meteorology data NetCDF files into 1x1pt_$SITE sub-directory 
# (with filenames of yyyy-mm.nc)
# The variables assumed to be on the files are: 
#     ZBOT, TBOT, RH, WIND, PRECTmms, FSDS, PSRF, FLDS
# (if other fields are available or with different names this can be changed by
#  editing the streams file in your case)

# Then create a case using the data you just created
setenv MYCASE "testPTCLM"
cd ../../../../../../scripts
./create_newcase -user_mods_dir $MYDATAFILES/1x1pt_$SITE -case $MYCASE -res CLM_USRDAT -compset ICLM451PT -mach yellowstone_intel

# Finally configure, build, and run the case as normal
cd $MYCASE
./cesm_setup
./$MYCASE.build
./$MYCASE.submit
